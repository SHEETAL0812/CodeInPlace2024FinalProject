# Sheetal Bharti- Code In Place 2024 Final Project
Code In Place 2024 Final Project 

The Project Contains numerous important elements for Data Analysis by using Python-
1. Project is based on Human Resource Data Analysis, which focuses on exploring the main reason for Attrition.
2. Project is started by importing or installing important Data Analysis and Data Visualization Libraries in Python such as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
3. Project uses Pandas Library to read CSV File from Desktop.
4. Project uses Data Info Function to see the detailed information about the dataset.
5. Project uses Data Describe Function to describe the numerical data of the dataset.
6. Project uses Data Describe "O" Function to describe the Objective data of the dataset.
7. Performed the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the Project to look the overview of the entire dataset.
8. Project sets the Targeted Column for the Metrics Calculation i.e., Attrition
9. Performed numerous Analysis to see which element provided in the dataset have an Impact over the Targeted Column which is Attrition.
10. Performed Analysis on Continuous Data in the project to check their impact over the Attrition.
11. Performed Graphical Representation of Continuous Data to understand the data in an easy way.
12. Performed Analysis on Discrete Data in the project to check their impact over the Attrition.
13. Performed Graphical Representation of Discrete Data to understand the data in an easy way.
14. Performed Data Pre-Processing to check the Null Values in the dataset.
15. Performed Data Cleaning.
16. Performed Trend analysis in the Project to make Prediction about the Future.
17. Performed Data Visualization to find useful insights from the data.
